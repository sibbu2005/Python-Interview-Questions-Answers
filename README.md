Python Interview Questions and Answers

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python’s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 

Nowadays the popularity of python is increasing day by day. Python is easy to learn and has vast libraries. In the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Python are the top priority in the implementation tool.  You can find on google the trends of top programming languages.

[Python Interview Questions](#https://www.interviewsortout.com/python-interview-questions/)

### What is Python?

	Python is an Interpreted programming language with objects, modules, threads, exceptions and automatic memory management. The benefits of pythons are that it is simple and easy, portable, extensible, built-in data structure and it is open-source.

### What are the key features of Python?

	*Python is an interpreted language. That means Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. 
	*Python is dynamically typed, this means that you don’t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. 
	*Python is well suited to object-orientated programming in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance. 
	*In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first-class objects
	*Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately，Python allows the inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are. 

### What type of language is python? Programming or scripting?

	Python is capable of scripting, but in a general sense, it is considered as a general-purpose programming language.

### What is PEP 8?

	PEP 8 is a coding convention, a set of recommendations about how to write your Python code more readable.

### What are Python packages?

	Python packages are namespaces containing multiple modules.

### What is the difference between abs () and fabs ()?

	*abs() is a built-in function that works with integer, float and complex numbers also.
	*fabs() is defined in the math module which doesn’t work with complex numbers.

### How Python is interpreted?

	Python is an interpreted language because Python program runs directly from the source code. It converts the source code that is written by the programmer into an intermediate language, which is again translated into machine language that has to be executed.

### How memory is managed in Python?

	Python has an awesome feature of memory management. The following points will explain memory management in python:

	*Python memory is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap and the interpreter takes care of this Python private heap.
	*The allocation of Python heap space for Python objects is done by the Python memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.
	*Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space.
 

### What are the tools that help to find bugs or perform the static analysis?

	PyChecker is a static analysis tool that detects bugs in Python source code and warns about the style and complexity of the bug. Pylint is another tool that verifies whether the module meets the coding standard.

 
### What are Python decorators?

	A Python decorator is a specific change that we make in Python syntax to alter functions easily.
